# Analytics-in-Sales- Predicting Sales for Big Mart Products
**Overview**

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the sales of various products across different stores of Big Mart based on historical sales data and other relevant features. The goal is to optimize inventory management and improve profitability by accurately forecasting product sales.

**Problem Statement**

Big Mart has collected sales data for the year 2013 from 10 stores located in different cities. The task is to build a predictive model that can forecast the sales of each product at a specific store. The model should leverage historical sales data, product attributes, store information, and other pertinent features available in the dataset.

**Scope**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the dataset through statistical summaries and visualizations to identify patterns and insights.
Model Development: Train and evaluate regression algorithms to predict product sales.
Feature Importance: Analyze and interpret the importance of different features in predicting sales.
Model Evaluation: Measure the performance of each model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2).


**Models and Performance**

The following regression models were evaluated:

**Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Ridge Regression
Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor**

**Conclusion**

This project illustrates the effective application of machine learning techniques in predicting product sales for Big Mart using historical data. The results from models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor indicate promising outcomes with lower errors, suggesting their suitability for sales forecasting tasks in retail settings.
Among the algorithms evaluated, the Random Forest Regressor emerged as the top performer for predicting product sales at Big Mart. It demonstrated the lowest Mean Absolute Error and competitive metrics across Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R-squared. This highlights its effectiveness in leveraging historical sales data and other relevant features to forecast sales accurately.
